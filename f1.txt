we can give inventories like this also:
[mywebservers]
192.168.0.134
192.168.1.234
if we want to write only for myplay then write:
---
- hosts: mywebservers
 -i means pickuping our own inventory otherwise default inventory will replace
execute :ansible all -i myhosts -m ping
there only execute webservers inventories only remaining inventories will give error
 ansible mywebservers -i myhosts -m ping
instead of all there we write only mywebserver





 - name: install webserver  on  ubuntu nodes
    apt:
